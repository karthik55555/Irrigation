# Automatic-Irrigation-System
Irrigation is the application of controlled amounts of water to plants at needed intervals. Irrigation helps to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall. Irrigation also has other uses in crop production, including frost protection,suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming.
Here we use four kind of sensors such as wireless soil moisture sensor,raindrop sensor,waterlevel sensor,temperature & humidity.

ADVANTAGES
*EACH AND EVERY CROPS DO DIFFER IN WATER LEVEL.
*WE USE WIRELESS SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR SO THAT LAYING OF WIRES WONT BE SO DIFFICULT AND IT WONT CAUSE ANY DAMAGES.


MODULES:
<b>KARTHIK.T(15CSA28)</b>

*SENSORS AND CONTROL INTEGRATION  -------

Description:The first module to describe was sensor and control integration. Here in this module there are four types of sensors such as soil moisture, water level, rain drop, temperature and humidity where these were integrated using esp8266 Wi-Fi module.

*SENSORS DATA TO CLOUD INTEGRATION ------

Description:Sensor data to cloud integration is that they collect data from the sensors and save it the local server cloud using XAMPP and PHPMYADMIN. This module continuously helps in updating all data into cloud for continuous access.

*SMART IRRIGATION APP MODULE  -----------


Desciption:The app module collects every data from the sensor and sends notifications to the user through mobile. First the user should login and enter the details.The crops will be displayed and when a particular crop was selected the sensor data will be sent as the notification to the user
